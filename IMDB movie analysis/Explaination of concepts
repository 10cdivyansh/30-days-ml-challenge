Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that deals with the interaction between computers and human languages. It focuses on developing algorithms and techniques to analyze, understand, and generate natural language. NLP is used in many applications such as sentiment analysis, language translation, speech recognition, chatbots, and more.

BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a pre-trained deep learning model for NLP developed by Google. It is based on the Transformer architecture and has achieved state-of-the-art performance in many NLP tasks, including question-answering, sentiment analysis, and text classification. BERT is trained on massive amounts of text data and can be fine-tuned on specific NLP tasks with relatively small amounts of task-specific data. It is widely used in industry and academia for various NLP applications.
